1. How to deal with Std IN / Std OUT?

2. For the coeff_p1 method, are the inputs ordered? Can there be repeats? Will they always follow with a ';' and the degree?
  - All inputs will be in order, with no repeats, and no errors, as follows: "COMMAND EXP COEFF;EXP COEFF;EXP COEFF;...".
  
3. Is there a limit to how many polynomials we can receive with the input?
